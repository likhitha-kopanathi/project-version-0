             About Bungee Jumping - Bungy Jumping</h1>

             <p>Bungee jumping - Bungy Jumping is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord. The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to hover above the ground. The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound. When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the energy is dissipated.</p>

                        <h2> activities in juming from heights</h2>

                        <p>Bungee Jump (83 mts): is the highest (83 mts) fixed platform BUNGY JUMPING (Bungee) in India. The bungee jumping is located at Mohanchatti near Rishikesh. A Cantilever platform built over a iron cliff over looking a rocky river HYUL, a tributary of River Ganga</p>

                        <p>Flying Fox (120 mts): There is fixed hard wire around 1 km, from one end of the valley to the other. You are harnessed to this apparatus which is released to gravity running on the wire from the height of 120 mtrs to achieve the speed of upto 140 to 160 kmph. Flying Fox in Rishikesh is usually done by three persons at a time. However if you desire you can pay extra to do it alone.

                        </p>

                        <p> Giant Swing (83 mts):  It is carried out from the same platform of the Bungee Jump. But instead of attaching a cord to your ankles, a seat harness is provided and two ropes are attached to it. So instead of a free fall after the jump, the ropes attached to the harness start swinging you like a pendulum hence acting like one Giant Swing tied from the height of 83 mtrs. The activity can also be done by two people at the same time.</p>
