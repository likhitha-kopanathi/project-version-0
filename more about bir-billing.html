            Bir is a noted centre for ecotourism, spiritual studies, and meditation.</p>

            <p> Bir is also home to a Tibetan refugee settlement with several Buddhist monasteries and a 
            large stupa.</p>
        
        <h2>History</h2>
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">Bir was ruled by the Pal dynasty of the Chandarvanshi lineage.The last Raja or Rai was Raizada Prithi Pal, who was a descendant of the Rajas of Bhangahal, who appear to have maintained their rights until the time of Raja Prithi Pal in the early part of the eighteenth century. Raja Prithi Pal fell victim to his father-in-law, Raja Sidh Sen, who in 1728 invited him to Mandi on the pretext of seeking his assistance against the Raja of Suket. He was kindly received, but within a month of his arrival, he was beguiled into the Damdama Fort, and there murdered. It is said his body was duly burnt, but his head was buried in a tank facing the Mandi Raja's palace. A pillar was erected on the spot, and light was kept burning on it for years. Sidh Sen's object in murdering Raja Prithi Pal was to seize his territory, but in this, he only partially succeeded. The forts at Jagapur, Tika Thana and the Patgana of Nir, with eighteen villages of Ilaga Chuhar (all of them until then forming part of the Bhangahal kingdom), were annexed to Mandi. Subsequently, Sidh Sen attempted to seize Karanpur, which also belonged to Bhangahal, but he was repulsed by Raja Raghunath Pal who had succeeded his father Raja Prithi Pal. In a second invasion, he penetrated as far as Kotharli Gulu, then in Bhangahal, but Raghunath Pal was able, with the assistance of Raja Thedi Singh of Kulu, not only to check his advance, but also to beat him back with considerable loss.</p>

       <p style= "font-size: 18px;">
        The Mughal Emperors always appreciated the loyalty of the Bhanghal chiefs, and when the news of repeated aggression of the 
        Mandhi Raja on Bhangahal reached the Emperor in Delhi, he deputed Adina Beg, Governor of Jullundur, to drive him off. 
        But the Khan died on the road at Dinanagar in 1732. The affair ended unfortunately for Raghunath Pal, who went to meet 
        the Governor, as Sham Sher Singh, then Raja of Mandi, took advantage of his absence to seize the much-coveted Ilaqa of 
        Karanpur.</p>

<pre style= "font-size: 18px;">
        Raghunath Pal died in 1749 and was succeeded by his son, Dalip Pal, whose reign was rendered memorable by a combined, though 
        unsuccessful, attack made on Bhangahal by the Rajas of Mandi, Kullu, Kahlur, Nalagarh, Guler and Jaswan. The united forces of 
        these chiefs encamped at Tika Changar and made an attempt to capture the Raja and his brother, Mian Bhim Pal, but were 
        eventually driven back with great loss. the Raja commemorated the victory by erecting several mounds composed of the heads 
        of his slaughtered foes. One of these mounds exists in the pine forest in Bir, and another stands on the banks of the Pun river 
        within the limits of Bhangahal.

        Bir was annexed in 1779 by the Raja of Kulu shortly before the death of Dalip Pal, whose son, Man Pal, succeeded only to the 
        Taaluqas of Lanod and Paprola. He died on his way to Delhi, whether he was proceeding with the object of enlisting the 
        sympathies of the Mughal Emperor in an attempt to make the recovery of his patrimony. The Rajas of Kangra and Guler took 
        advantage of ManPal's absence to seize villages and lands, Kangra appropriating Lanod and Paprola and Guler the remaining 
        property. Man Pal's widow and her infant son, Uchal Pal sought refuge at Rehlu with Raja Rai Singh of Chamba, who gave her 
        a home and allowed her a small jagir.
        In 1785, when Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra married a daughter of Man Pal, he lent Uchal Pal a small force to help him in 
        recovering his lands from Mandi Raja. This latter chief had recourse to stratagem. He bought off Sansar Chand's principal 
        officer and persuaded Raja Rai Singh of Chamba to carry war into Katoch dominions. When Sansar Chand found that Rai Singh 
        had advanced within a short distance of Kangra, he had to muster all his available forces, including the portion he had lent 
        to Uchal Pal. After the battle of Nerti, in which Raja Rai Singh was defeated and killed, the Mandi and Kullu rajas secured 
        the possession of Bangahal by paying Sansar Chand five lakh rupees (INR 500,000).
