        <p class=h>Due to its massive size, India is blessed with a diverse landscape. The country is known for being tourist friendly, with something in store for every type of traveller, both international and domestic</p>
        <p>If adventure is your thing, there is no better country than India to experience all kinds of thrills and activities. We have compiled a list of the best adventure places in India to satisfy your cravings for that perfect adrenaline rush. Let’s take a look at the best adventure places in India</p>
        <p>Adventure travel is a type of niche tourism, involving exploration or travel with a certain degree of risk (real or perceived), and which may require special skills and physical exertion. In the United States, adventure tourism has grown in recent decades as tourists seek out-of-the-ordinary or "roads less traveled" vacations, but lack of a clear operational definition has hampered measurement of market size and growth. According to the U.S.-based Adventure Travel Trade Association, adventure travel may be any tourist activity that includes physical activity, a cultural exchange, and connection with nature.This wide definition is demonstrated by examples as contrasting as adventure tourism simply being travel to destinations that are “less visited” or involve gentle physical activity versus very physically or mentally demanding travel</p>

            <li style="font-size:20px" class="b"><b>bir-billing</b>-Bir-Billing is a village settled in the Joginder Valley of Himachal Pradesh. The place portrays a typical and idyllic village setting. However, very close to the village you will find an entirely different picture.

                The entire sky is filled with paragliders enjoying this adventure sport. The hills and the climate make Bir-Billing the perfect spot to go paragliding. It is for this reason Bir-Billing is called the paragliding capital of the nation.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li style="font-size:20px" class="b"><b>rajasthan</b>-Rajasthan is not all about royal palaces and forts. It is a land that will also delight the adventure lover in you. Lately, hot air ballooning is gaining traction in the state. You can either choose to train in the science of hot air ballooning and then perform the activity under guided supervision or you can take a hot air balloon tour.

                The tour throws an entirely new perspective on Rajasthan and will give you a bird’s eye view of the cities of Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur.</li>


                <br></br>

                    You can engage in activities such as rafting in the Ganga River, rock and cliff climbing, take part in a survival camp at the nearby forest or go bungee jumping. The bungee jump is the highest in India at a staggering 83 meters high – leaving you in freefall for a whole 5 seconds</li>

                    <br></br>
                    <li style="font-size:20px"  class="b"><b>ladakh</b>-Ladakh is known as the land of many monasteries. The town is located at the highest altitude in India. The topography of the surrounding land makes it the perfect place to go trekking and rafting.
